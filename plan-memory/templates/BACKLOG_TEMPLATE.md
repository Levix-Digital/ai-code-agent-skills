# Backlog

Work captured for later planning: bugs, features, improvements and adjustments, grouped under epics when the product is planned as a whole. Capturing an item takes no discovery; when the user decides to work on items, they are promoted into a plan (`plan-memory/backlog.py promote`), where the discovery and the planning happen. Open bugs come before new work.

Each item: `### <ID>: <title>` with the fields `Severity` (bugs: critical, high, medium, low) or `Priority` (others: high, medium, low), an optional `Epic`, `Status` (open, planned, in_progress), `Found`, `Plan` and `Description`. Epics (`EPIC-NNN`) group items of the complete product; they have no `Plan` and are never promoted: their items are. The roadmap (`docs/ROADMAP.md`) says which items go into which release. Closed items (done, dropped, duplicate) move to `Closed` with a `Closed` note and keep their ids, which are never reused. Edit this file with `plan-memory/backlog.py` or by hand, and check it with `backlog.py validate`.
